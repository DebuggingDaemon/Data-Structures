# Data Structures Course Project

This repository contains my project for the **Data Structures** course. It showcases several implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures, along with common sorting and searching algorithms.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. First Exercise - Basic Algorithms
Located in the `firstexercise` folder.

This section includes **generic implementations** of:

- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms

### 2. Second Exercise - Advanced Data Structures
Located in the `secondexercise` folder.

This section contains implementations of:

- **AVL Tree** - A self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Hash Table with Chains** - Each chain is implemented as an **AVL Tree** rather than a linked list, for improved performance in certain scenarios.

## 📊 Data Set
To test the performance and correctness of these implementations, I used a **large dataset** containing information on **births and deaths by region**.

---

Feel free to explore the code and see how these structures and algorithms work in practice. This project was an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience with both **classic algorithms** and **more advanced data structures**.

### 🔗 Notes
- This project was developed as part of my **Data Structures** course.
- The code is written in C++
